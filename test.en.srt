1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,160
I hope you're here to tell me
you've put the Vic on the market.

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,760
No.

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,400
I was thinking about
a little refurb.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
You know, a few more bells and
whistles. Improved lunchtime menu.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,600
Well, when you sell the Vic,

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,440
you'll have the money to do
what you want, won't you?

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,960
You know what, Max? I am fed up
with you telling me what to do.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,880
What you talking about?

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,760
Well, I fully intended to sign
back your share, you know,

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,120
if you'd given me time.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
But you had to push it too
far, didn't you?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,440
Yeah, yeah... I mean, the things
I did to try and pay you back.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,760
Get to the point, Ian.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm not going to sell the Vic.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
You what?

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,400
In fact, you're not going to get
another penny from me, full stop.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm sorry, Ian, have you
had a bang on the head?

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,240
Unless you want the whole Square
to find out about your little

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
affair with Linda Carter.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
You ready?

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
Right, come on.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,040
What's the matter with Daddy?

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,320
He's just a bit tired, that's all.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,520
Go on, go.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Veggie, yeah?

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Yeah, I thought
I'd better give it a go.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,920
So how many missed calls
was last night, then?

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Five, and that was before
I turned my phone off.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,120
They're just excited.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Yeah, I can tell.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Oh, Rainie, can I just finish my
hash brown before we start

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
talking periods? Is that all right?

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't be silly.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm really sorry about what
happened yesterday.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
I overstepped the mark.
